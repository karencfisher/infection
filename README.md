# infection
Simplified model of infection rate affected by rates of social distancing

Based on the model from Penn Medical, at https://github.com/pennsignals/chime. Simplified to project only total infections, and plot by percentages of social distancing, to look at the hypothesis that social distancing will 'flatten the curve.'
