# infection
Simplified model of COVID-19 infection rate affected by rates of social distancing (I really didn't believe the graphs shown in the media, until seeing an actual model.)

Based on the model from Penn Medical, at https://github.com/pennsignals/chime. Simplified to project only total infections, and plot by percentages of social distancing, to look at the hypothesis that social distancing will 'flatten the curve.'
